    <string name="intro_text">We humans like to give our precious numbers some significance, so why not times? This app reminds you to celebrate the small moments where the numbers on your watch pretend to have meaning. Use the pre-made, obvious ones like 07:07 and 12:12 or add your own.
        \nWhat\'s your Fancy Time?</string>

    <string name="about_the_app">This app is based on the habit of being mildly excited about more or less special times, and thus serves mainly for learning purposes through its development as well as some short term entertainment through its use.
        Aside from that you may find it useful as a reminder of daily task around the same time as you can fully customize the times you want to be reminded of.</string>

    <string name="about_me">I\'m from Germany and, as of November 2020, am studying and developing on my own after recently finishing school and soon starting to study at university.
